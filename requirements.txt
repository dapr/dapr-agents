# DEPRECATED: This file is deprecated in favor of pyproject.toml dependency management
# 
# For local development with local python-sdk, use:
#   pip install -r requirements-dev-local.txt
#
# For regular development, use:
#   pip install .[dev-complete]
#
# For testing only, use:
#   pip install .[test-all]
#
# See DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md for detailed instructions.

# Legacy dependencies (now in pyproject.toml):
# python-dotenv==1.0.0  -> moved to core dependencies
# requests==2.31.0      -> already in core dependencies  
# -e ../python-sdk      -> now in requirements-dev-local.txt
